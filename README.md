Disclaimer

It first came originally from a mixture of other proyect and I thank to all of them and their proyects. I do not take credit of any solution that came out of this app.

The following app was developed in html and php and has the following functions:
-Keep a record of the registered users spliting them in admins and users.
  -Admins have the privileges to create, modify and deactivate users. They also have the privileges to create, modify and erase products      in stock.
  -On the other hand, users only have access to look for products and to keep a record history of what they search.
